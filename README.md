# Global-wheat-detection

I participated in a team in the Kaggle global wheat detection competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/global-wheat-Detection as the final project for the Digital agro course at Skoltech.

In one file, you can find the data preparation including data argumentation (the link to the dataset is in the notebook), in the other the final (less complex) data preprocessing and the detection model development using different NN including fasterRCNN with pre-trained ResNet50 as autoencoder. Which offered the best result and is in the notebook's final version. Also, the project results presentation is included.
